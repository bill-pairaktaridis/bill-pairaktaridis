### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30" />, I'm Bill!

I'm a software engineer based in Athens, Greece with over 11 years of experience. I've worked all ends of the stack, from back to front to back again! 

Nowadays I primarily focus on the front-end, with a heavy focus on React and React Native. I also like to play around with Python and Django (as I am a perfectionist with deadlines).

I'm also part of [Braintrust](https://app.usebraintrust.com/talent/3258/), a premium talent platform built on the blockchain. 

Currently, I'm part of [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/) as a Senior Front-End Engineer.
